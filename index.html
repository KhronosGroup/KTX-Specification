<h2>Field Descriptions</h2>
<h3>identifier</h3>
<p>The file identifier is a unique set of bytes that will differentiate the file 
  from other types of files. It consists of 12 bytes, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Byte[12] FileIdentifier = {
   0xAB, 0x4B, 0x54, 0x58, 0x20, 0x31, 0x31, 0xBB, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This can also be expressed using C-style character definitions as: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Byte[12] FileIdentifier = {
    '&laquo;', 'K', 'T', 'X', ' ', '1', '1', '&raquo;', '\r', '\n', '\x1A', '\n'
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The rationale behind the choice values in the identifier is based on the rationale 
  for the identifier in the PNG specification. This identifier both identifies 
  the file as a KTX file and provides for immediate detection of common file-transfer 
  problems. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Byte [0] is chosen as a non-ASCII value to reduce the probability that a 
    text file may be misrecognized as a KTX file.</li>
  <li>Byte [0] also catches bad file transfers that clear bit 7.</li>
  <li>Bytes [1..6] identify the format, and are the ascii values for the string 
    "KTX 11".</li>
  <li>Byte [7] is for aesthetic balance with byte 1 (they are a matching pair 
    of double-angle quotation marks).</li>
  <li>Bytes [8..9] form a CR-LF sequence which catches bad file transfers that 
    alter newline sequences.</li>
  <li>Byte [10] is a control-Z character, which stops file display under MS-DOS, 
    and further reduces the chance that a text file will be falsely recognised.</li>
  <li>Byte [11] is a final line feed, which checks for the inverse of the CR-LF 
    translation problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>endianness</h3>
<p> endianness contains the number 0x04030201 written as a 32 bit integer. If 
  the file is little endian then this is represented as the bytes 0x01 0x02 0x03 
  0x04. If the file is big endian then this is represented as the bytes 0x04 0x03 
  0x02 0x01. When reading endianness as a 32 bit integer produces the value 0x04030201 
  then the endianness of the file matches the the endianness of the program that 
  is reading the file and no conversion is necessary. When reading endianness 
  as a 32 bit integer produces the value 0x01020304 then the endianness of the 
  file is opposite the endianness of the program that is reading the file, and 
  in that case the program reading the file must endian convert all header bytes 
  to the endianness of the program (i.e. a little endian program must convert 
  from big endian, and a big endian program must convert to little endian).</p>
<h3>glType</h3>
<p>For compressed textures, glType must equal 0. For uncompressed textures, 
  glType specifies the <code>type</code> parameter passed to <code>glTex{,Sub}Image*D</code>, usually one of the 
  values from <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec44.core.pdf#nameddest=table-8.2">table 8.2</a> of the OpenGL 4.4 specification <a href="#refsGL44">[OPENGL44]</a> (UNSIGNED_BYTE, UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5, 
  etc.)</p>
<h3>glTypeSize</h3>
<p> glTypeSize specifies the data type size that should be used when 
  endianness conversion is required for the texture data stored in the 
  file. If glType is not 0, this should be the size in bytes corresponding 
  to glType. For texture data which does not depend on platform endianness, 
  including compressed texture data, glTypeSize must equal 1.</p>
<h3>glFormat</h3>
<p>For compressed textures, glFormat must equal 0. For uncompressed textures, 
  glFormat specifies the <code>format</code> parameter passed to <code>glTex{,Sub}Image*D</code>, usually one of 
  the values from <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec44.core.pdf#nameddest=table-8.3">table 8.3</a> of the OpenGL 4.4 specification <a href="#refsGL44">[OPENGL44]</a> (RGB, RGBA, BGRA, 
  etc.)</p>
<h3>glInternalFormat</h3>
<p> For compressed textures, glInternalFormat must equal the compressed internal format, 
  usually one of the values from <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec44.core.pdf#nameddest=table-8.14">table 8.14</a> of the OpenGL 4.4 specification <a href="#refsGL44">[OPENGL44]</a>. For 
  uncompressed textures, glInternalFormat specifies the <code>internalformat</code> parameter 
  passed to <code>glTexStorage*D</code> or <code>glTexImage*D</code>, usually one of the sized internal formats from <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec44.core.pdf#nameddest=table-8.12">tables 8.12 & 8.13</a> of the OpenGL 4.4 specification <a href="#refsGL44">[OPENGL44]</a>. The sized format should be chosen 
  to match the bit depth of the data provided. glInternalFormat is used when 
  loading both compressed and uncompressed textures, except when loading into a context that does not support sized formats, such as an unextended OpenGL ES 2.0 context where  the <code>internalformat</code> parameter is required to have the same value 
  as the <code>format</code> parameter.</p>
<h3>glBaseInternalFormat</h3>
<p> For both compressed and uncompressed textures, glBaseInternalFormat specifies 
  the base internal format of the texture, usually one of the values from <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec44.core.pdf#nameddest=table-8.11">table 8.11</a> of the OpenGL 4.4 specification <a href="#refsGL44">[OPENGL44]</a> (RGB, RGBA, ALPHA, etc.). For uncompressed 
  textures, this value will be the same as glFormat and is used as the <code>internalformat</code> parameter when loading into a context that does not support sized formats, such as an unextended OpenGL ES 2.0 context.</p>
<h3>pixelWidth, pixelHeight, pixelDepth</h3>
<p> The size of the texture image for level 0, in pixels. No rounding to block
  sizes should be applied for block compressed textures.</p>
<p> For 1D textures pixelHeight and pixelDepth must be 0.
  For 2D and cube textures pixelDepth must be 0.</p>
<h3>numberOfArrayElements</h3>
<p>numberOfArrayElements specifies the number of array elements. If the 
  texture is not an array texture, numberOfArrayElements must equal 0.</p>
<h3>numberOfFaces</h3>
<p>numberOfFaces specifies the number of cubemap faces. For cubemaps and 
  cubemap arrays this should be 6. For non cubemaps this should be 1. 
  Cube map faces are stored in the order: +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z.</p>
<h3>numberOfMipmapLevels</h3>
<p>numberOfMipmapLevels must equal 1 for non-mipmapped textures. For 
  mipmapped textures, it equals the number of mipmaps. Mipmaps are stored 
  in order from largest size to smallest size. The first mipmap level is 
  always level 0. A KTX file does not need to contain a complete mipmap 
  pyramid. If numberOfMipmapLevels equals 0, it indicates that a full 
  mipmap pyramid should be generated from level 0 at load time (this is 
  usually not allowed for compressed formats).</p>
<h3>bytesOfKeyValueData</h3>
<p>An arbitrary number of key/value pairs may follow the header. This can be
  used to encode any arbitrary data. The bytesOfKeyValueData field
  indicates the total number of bytes of key/value data including all
  keyAndValueByteSize fields, all keyAndValue fields, and all valuePadding
  fields. The file offset of the first imageSize field is located at the
  file offset of the bytesOfKeyValueData field plus the value of the
  bytesOfKeyValueData field plus 4.</p>
<h3>keyAndValueByteSize</h3>
<p>keyAndValueByteSize is the number of bytes of combined key and value data in 
  one key/value pair following the header. This includes the size of the key, 
  the NUL byte terminating the key, and all the bytes of data in the value. If 
  the value is a UTF-8 string it should be NUL terminated and the keyAndValueByteSize 
  should include the NUL character (but code that reads KTX files must not assume 
  that value fields are NUL terminated). keyAndValueByteSize does not include 
  the bytes in valuePadding.</p>
<h3>keyAndValue</h3>
<p>keyAndValue contains 2 separate sections. First it contains a key encoded in 
  UTF-8. The key must be terminated by a NUL character (a single 0x00 byte). Keys 
  that begin with the 3 ascii characters 'KTX' or 'ktx' are reserved and must 
  not be used except as described by this spec (this version of the KTX spec defines 
  a <a href="#key">single key</a>). Immediately following the NUL character that 
  terminates the key is the Value data.</p>
<p>The Value data may consist of any arbitrary data bytes. Any byte value is allowed. 
  It is encouraged that the value be a NUL terminated UTF-8 string, but this is 
  not required. If the Value data is binary, it is a sequence of bytes rather 
  than of words. It is up to the vendor defining the key to specify how those 
  bytes are to be interpreted (including the endianness of any encoded numbers). 
  If the Value data is a string of bytes then the NUL termination should be included 
  in the keyAndValueByteSize byte count (but programs that read KTX files must 
  not rely on this).</p>
<h3>valuePadding</h3>
<p>valuePadding contains between 0 and 3 bytes to ensure that the byte following 
  the last byte in valuePadding is at a file offset that is a multiple of 4. This 
  ensures that every keyAndValueByteSize field, and the first imageSize field, 
  is 4 byte aligned. This padding is included in the bytesOfKeyValueData field 
  but not the individual keyAndValueByteSize fields.</p>
<h3>imageSize</h3>
<p>For most textures imageSize is the number of bytes of pixel data in the current 
  LOD level. This includes all z slices, all faces, all rows (or rows of blocks) 
  and all pixels (or blocks) in each row for the mipmap level. It does not include 
  any bytes in mipPadding.</p>
<p> The exception is non-array cubemap textures (any texture where numberOfFaces 
  is 6 and numberOfArrayElements is 0). For these textures imageSize is the number 
  of bytes in each face of the texture for the current LOD level, not including 
  bytes in cubePadding or mipPadding.</p>
<h3>cubePadding</h3>
<p> For non-array cubemap textures (any texture where numberOfFaces is 6 and numberOfArrayElements 
  is 0) cubePadding contains between 0 and 3 bytes to ensure that the data in 
  each face begins at a file offset that is a multiple of 4. In all other cases 
  cubePadding is empty (0 bytes long).</p>
<h3>mipPadding</h3>
<p>Between 0 and 3 bytes to make sure that all imageSize fields are at a
  file offset that is a multiple of 4.</p>
<h2>General comments</h2>
<p>The unpack alignment is 4. I.e. uncompressed pixel data is packed according 
  to the rules described in <a href=    "http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec44.core.pdf#nameddest=section-8.4.4.1">section 8.4.4.1</a> of the OpenGL 4.4 specification <a href="#refsGL44">[OPENGL44]</a> for a GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT of 4.</p>
<p> Values listed in tables referred to in the OpenGL 4.4 specification <a href="#refsGL44">[OPENGL44]</a> may be 
  supplemented by extensions. The references are given as examples and do not 
  imply that all of those texture types can be loaded in OpenGL ES or earlier 
  versions of OpenGL.</p>
<p>Texture data in a KTX file are arranged so that the first pixel in the data 
  stream for each face and/or array element is closest to the origin of the texture 
  coordinate system. In OpenGL that origin is conventionally described as being 
  at the lower left, but this convention is not shared by all image file formats 
  and content creation tools, so there is abundant room for confusion.</p>
<p>The desired texture axis orientation is often predetermined by, e.g. a content 
  creation tool's or existing application's use of the image. Therefore it is 
  strongly recommended that tools for generating KTX files clearly describe their 
  behaviour, and provide an option to specify the texture axis origin and orientation 
  relative to the logical orientation of the source image. At minimum they should 
  provide a choice between top-left and bottom-left as origin for 2D source images, 
  with the positive S axis pointing right. Where possible, the preferred default 
  is to use the logical upper-left corner of the image as the texture origin. 
  Note that this is contrary to the standard interpretation of GL texture coordinates. 
  However, the majority of texture compression tools use this convention.</p>
<p>As an aid to writing image manipulation tools and viewers, the logical orientation 
  of the data in a KTX file may be indicated in the file's key/value metadata. 
  Note that this metadata affects only the logical interpretation of the data, 
  has no effect on the mapping from pixels in the file byte stream to texture 
  coordinates. The recommended key to use is:</p>
<ul>
  <a name="keys" id="keys"></a>
  <li>KTXorientation </li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that viewing and editing tools support at least the following 
  values:</p>
<ul>
  <li> S=r,T=d</li>
  <li>S=r,T=u</li>
  <li>S=r,T=d,R=i</li>
  <li>S=r,T=u,R=o</li>
</ul>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
  <li>S indicates the direction of increasing S values</li>
  <li>T indicates the direction of increasing T values</li>
  <li>R indicates the direction of increasing R values</li>
  <li>r indicates increasing to the right</li>
  <li>l indicates increasing to the left</li>
  <li>d indicates increasing downwards</li>
  <li>u indicates increasing upwards</li>
  <li>o indicates increasing out from the screen (moving towards viewer)</li>
  <li>i indicates increasing in towards the screen (moving away from viewer) </li>
</ul>
<p>Although other orientations can be represented, it is recommended that tools 
  that create KTX files use only the values listed above as other values may not 
  be widely supported by other tools.</p>

<h2>IANA Mime-Type Registration Information</h2>
<p class="copyright"><em>Permission is expressly granted to IANA to copy this 
  section as necessary for managing the MIME types registry.</em></p>
<p> Type name: Image</p>
<p> Subtype name: ktx</p>
<p> Required parameters: none</p>
<p> Optional parameters: none</p>
<p> Encoding considerations: binary</p>
<p>Security considerations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ktx type is a binary data stream which contains no executable code that 
    could disrupt a client processor. There is no provision in the type specification 
    that would allow authors to insert executable code that would present any 
    security risk to a client machine.</p>
  <p>Because every item's length is available at its beginning, there is robust 
    defense against corrupted or fraudulent data that might overflow a decoder's 
    buffer. Also the signature bytes provide early detection of common file transmission 
    errors.</p>
  <p>The ktx type may contain texture data compressed using OpenGL standard or 
    vendor-specific schemes. These compression schemes are designed so small blocks 
    of data (typically around 64 bits) can be decompressed in real time into a 
    small block of pixels (typically 4x4) during texel fetch. In such schemes 
    it is not possible for a small amount of data to expand enormously because 
    the level of compression is limited; the compressed size is related directly 
    to the number of pixels in the uncompressed image and not to the content of 
    the data.</p>
  <p>The ktx type does not provide encryption of the data payload. Users or applications 
    wishing or needing to keep their images confidential must overlay their own 
    encryption on the ktx data during transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Interoperability considerations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ktx type includes a field identifying the endianness of the machine which 
    created the data. Applications reading the data are expected to check this 
    field and convert the endianness, if necessary. The texture data payload may 
    be compressed using an OpenGL-vendor-specific scheme. In this case, only devices 
    or applications having a matching decompressor will be able to display the 
    data. The compression scheme is identified in the ktx data so applications 
    can quickly reject data using unsupported schemes.</p>
