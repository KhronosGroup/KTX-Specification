== Abstract
KTX2 is a format for storing textures for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan applications.
It is distinguished by the simplicity of the loader required to instantiate texture
objects from the file contents.

It extends the KTX format with support for easier loading of Vulkan
textures, easier use by non-OpenGL and non-Vulkan applications, storage of
multisample images, streaming and global compression.

== Field Descriptions

=== identifier
The file identifier is a unique set of bytes that will differentiate the file 
from other types of files. It consists of 12 bytes, as follows:
[listing]
----
Byte[12] FileIdentifier = {
  0xAB, 0x4B, 0x54, 0x58, 0x20, 0x31, 0x31, 0xBB, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A
}
----
This can also be expressed using C-style character definitions as:
[listing]
----
Byte[12] FileIdentifier = {
  '«', 'K', 'T', 'X', ' ', '2', '2', '»', '\r', '\n', '\x1A', '\n'
}
----
The rationale behind the choice of values in the identifier is based on the rationale 
for the identifier in the PNG specification. This identifier both identifies 
the file as a KTX file and provides for immediate detection of common file-transfer 
problems.

  * Byte [0] is chosen as a non-ASCII value to reduce the probability that a 
    text file may be misrecognized as a KTX file.
  * Byte [0] also catches bad file transfers that clear bit 7.
  * Bytes [1..6] identify the format, and are the ascii values for the string 
    "KTX 22".
  * Byte [7] is for aesthetic balance with byte 1 (they are a matching pair 
    of double-angle quotation marks).
  * Bytes [8..9] form a CR-LF sequence which catches bad file transfers that 
    alter newline sequences.
  * Byte [10] is a control-Z character, which stops file display under MS-DOS, 
    and further reduces the chance that a text file will be falsely recognised.
  * Byte [11] is a final line feed, which checks for the inverse of the CR-LF 
    translation problem.

=== endianness
`endianness` contains the number 0x04030201 written as a 32 bit
integer. If the file is little endian then this is represented as
the bytes 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04. If the file is big endian then this
is represented as the bytes 0x04 0x03 0x02 0x01. When reading
`endianness` as a 32 bit integer produces the value 0x04030201 then
the endianness of the file matches the the endianness of the
program that is reading the file and no conversion is necessary.
When reading `endianness` as a 32 bit integer produces the value
0x01020304 then the endianness of the file is opposite the
endianness of the program that is reading the file. In that
case the program reading the file must endian convert all header
UInt32s and, when `glTypeSize != 1`, all `data` to the endianness
of the program (i.e. a little endian program must convert from big
endian, and a big endian program must convert from little endian).

=== glType
For block compressed textures, `glType` must equal 0. For uncompressed
textures, `glType` specifies the type parameter passed to
glTex{,Sub}Image*D, usually one of the values from table 8.2 of the
OpenGL 4.6 specification <<OPENGL46>> (UNSIGNED_BYTE, UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5,
etc.)

=== glTypeSize
`glTypeSize` specifies the data type size that should be used when
endianness conversion is required for the texture data stored in
the file. If glType is not 0, this should be the size in bytes
corresponding to glType. For texture data which does not depend on
platform endianness, including block compressed texture data,
`glTypeSize` must equal 1.

=== glFormat
For block compressed textures, `glFormat` must equal 0. For
uncompressed textures, `glFormat` specifies the format parameter
passed to glTex{,Sub}Image*D, usually one of the values from table
8.3 of the OpenGL 4.6 specification <<OPENGL46>> (RGB, RGBA, BGRA,
etc.)

=== glInternalFormat
For block compressed textures, `glInternalFormat` must equal the
compressed internal format, usually one of the values from table
8.14 of the OpenGL 4.6 specification <<OPENGL46>>. For uncompressed
textures, `glInternalFormat` specifies the internalformat parameter
passed to glTexStorage*D or glTexImage*D, usually one of the sized
internal formats from tables 8.12 & 8.13 of the OpenGL 4.6 specification
<<OPENGL46>>. The sized format should be chosen to match the bit
depth of the data provided. `glInternalFormat` is used when loading
both compressed and uncompressed textures, except when loading into
a context that does not support sized formats, such as an unextended
OpenGL ES 2.0 context where the internalformat parameter is required
to have the same value as the format parameter.

`glInternalFormat` can take the value GL_FORMAT_UNDEFINED if the format
of the data is not a recognized OpenGL format such as one that appears
only in Vulkan.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There is currently no such token. A value will be requested from the
OpenGL registry. Whether to include this token in the GL namespace
and `gl.h` will have to be discussed by the working groups.
====

=== vkFormat
`vkFormat` specifies the Vulkan image format, usually one of the values
from the `VkFormat` enum in section 30.3.1 of the Vulkan 1.0
specification <<VULKAN10>>. VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED can be used if the format
of the data is a not a recognized Vulkan format.

=== pixelWidth, pixelHeight, pixelDepth
The size of the texture image for level 0, in pixels. No rounding
to block sizes should be applied for block compressed textures.

For 1D textures `pixelHeight` and `pixelDepth` must be 0. For 2D and
cube textures `pixelDepth` must be 0.

=== numberOfArrayElements
`numberOfArrayElements` specifies the number of array elements. If
the texture is not an array texture, `numberOfArrayElements` must
equal 0.

=== numberOfFaces
`numberOfFaces` specifies the number of cubemap faces. For cubemaps
and cubemap arrays this should be 6. For non cubemaps this should
be 1. Cube map faces are stored in the order: +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z,
-Z.

=== numberOfMipmapLevels
`numberOfMipmapLevels` must equal 1 for non-mipmapped textures. For
mipmapped textures, it equals the number of mipmaps. Mipmaps are
ordered according to the value of the `levelOrder` field.  A KTX
file does not need to contain a complete mipmap pyramid. If
`numberOfMipmapLevels` equals 0, it indicates that a full mipmap
pyramid should be generated from level 0 at load time (this is
usually not allowed for compressed formats).

=== levelOrder
`levelOrder` indicates the ordering of the mipmap levels.  If 0,
it indicates the levels are ordered from base level (the largest)
to max level (the smallest).  If 1, it indicates the levels ordered
from the max level to base level. If `numberOfMipmapLevels == 0`,
`levelOrder` must equal 0.

[TIP]
.Rationale
====
When streaming a KTX file, sending smaller mip levels first can be
used together with, e.g., the `GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL` and
`GL_TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL` texture parameters, to display something
quickly without waiting for the entire texture data.
====

=== Data Format Descriptor
The next 3 items combined form a _Data Format Descriptor_, (dfDescriptor),
that describing the layout of the texel blocks in `data`.
The full specification for this can be found in the Khronos Data
Format 1.2 Specification <<KDF12>>.

The dfDescriptor is partially expanded here in order to provide
sufficient information for a KTX2 file to be parsed without having to
refer to <<KDF12>>. If consists of one or more _Descriptor Blocks_
(dfDescriptorBlock).

The Data Format Descriptor describes the  data as it is when
`dataCompressionScheme == 0` or after decompression.

[TIP]
.Rationale
====
`dfFormatDescriptor` is useful in the following cases:

* precise color management using the descriptor's color space
  information,
* storing multi-sample images. Neither OpenGL nor Vulkan define formats
  or an API for loading these. Applications can use the descriptor and
  a custom shader to load these.
* easier use of the images by non-OpenGL and non-Vulkan applications.
  There will be no need for large tables to interpret format enums.
* easier calculation of the offsets of each level, face and layer within
  the data. Again there will be no need for large tables.
====

==== bytesOfDataFormatDescriptor
Called `total_size` in <<KFD12>>, `bytesOfDataFormatDescriptor`
indicates the total number of bytes in the dfDescriptor including
all dfDescriptorBlocks and all `blockPadding` fields.

==== descriptorBlock
A `Descriptor Block` as defined in <<KDF12>>, the high-order 16
bits of its first UInt32 give the descriptor type and the high-order
16 bits of the second UInt32 give the `descriptor_block_size`.

==== blockPadding
`blockPadding` contains between 0 and 3 bytes to ensure that the byte
following the last byte in `blockPadding` is at a file offset that is a
multiple of 4. This ensures that every `descriptorBlock` field and the
following `bytesOfKeyValueData` field are 4-byte aligned. This padding
is included in `bytesOfFormatDescriptor` but not in the individual
`descriptor_block_sizes`.

The _Khronos Basic Data Format Descriptor Block_ which will be the type
used in the vast majority of cases has a length guaranteed to be a
multiple of 4 so typically there will be 0 bytes of padding.

=== bytesOfKeyValueData
An arbitrary number of key/value pairs may follow the header. This
can be used to encode any arbitrary data. The `bytesOfKeyValueData`
field indicates the total number of bytes of key/value data including
all `keyAndValueByteSize` fields, all `keyAndValue` fields, and all
`valuePadding` fields. The file offset of the `dataCompressionScheme`
field is located at the file offset of the `bytesOfKeyValueData`
field plus the value of the `bytesOfKeyValueData` field plus 4.

=== keyAndValueByteSize
`keyAndValueByteSize` is the number of bytes of combined key and value
data in one key/value pair following the header. This includes the
size of the key, the NUL byte terminating the key, and all the bytes
of data in the value. If the value is a UTF-8 string it should be
NUL terminated and the `keyAndValueByteSize` should include tlhe NUL
character (but code that reads KTX files must not assume that value
fields are NUL terminated). `keyAndValueByteSize` does not include
the bytes in `valuePadding`.

=== keyAndValue
`keyAndValue` contains 2 separate sections. First it contains a key
encoded in UTF-8. The key must be terminated by a NUL character (a
single 0x00 byte). Keys that begin with the 3 ascii characters 'KTX'
or 'ktx' are reserved and must not be used except as described by
this spec (this version of the KTX spec defines two keys).
Immediately following the NUL character that terminates the key is
the Value data.

The Value data may consist of any arbitrary data bytes. Any byte
value is allowed. It is encouraged that the value be a NUL terminated
UTF-8 string, but this is not required. If the Value data is binary,
it is a sequence of bytes rather than of words. It is up to the
vendor defining the key to specify how those bytes are to be
interpreted (including the endianness of any encoded numbers). If
the Value data is a string of bytes then the NUL termination should
be included in the `keyAndValueByteSize` byte count (but programs
that read KTX files must not rely on this).

=== valuePadding
`valuePadding` contains between 0 and 3 bytes to ensure that the byte
following the last byte in `valuePadding` is at a file offset that
is a multiple of 4. This ensures that every `keyAndValueByteSize`
field is 4-byte aligned. This padding is included in the
`bytesOfKeyValueData` field but not the individual `keyAndValueByteSize`
fields.

=== dataCompressionScheme
`dataCompressionScheme` indicates if an optional lossless compression
scheme has been applied globally to `images`. This is entirely
separate from, and should not be confused with, block compressed
texture formats where the texture in compressed form can be  sampled
by the GPU. When a global compression scheme is used, the image
data must be decompressed prior to GPU sampling. `dataCompressionScheme`
must be one of the following values:

[width=50%,cols="^30,<70"]
|===
| 0           | Uncompressed
| 1           | ZLib compression
| 2           | tANS (?)
| 3           | zstd
| 4･･･2^32^-1 | Reserved
|===

WARNING: Need references.

A registry will be established to issue values in the reserved range
for vendor compression schemes thus avoiding conflicts.

[NOTE]
====
Lossless compression is generally ineffective on block-compressed
GPU-texture-formatted data as emitted by most tools. It is best
reserved for use with uncompressed texture formats or with
block-compressed data that has been optimized for further lossless
compression such as by using _rate distortion optimization_.

Global compression is incompatible with streaming. The entire file
content must be available before it can be decompressed.
====

=== totalDataSize
The total size of the data in `images`.

=== uncompressedDataSize
The size of the data in `images` when uncompressed. When
`dataCompressionScheme` is 0, `totalDataSize` must have the same
value as this. `uncompressedDataSize` includes the sum of all
`mipPadding` fields.

=== images
A block containing all image data for all the images in the texture.
When `dataCompressionScheme != 0` the content is defined by the
compression scheme. The result of decompression must be a structure
identical to that when `dataCompressionScheme == 0`.

=== imageSize
For most textures `imageSize` is the number of bytes of pixel data
in the current LOD level. This includes all z slices, all faces,
all rows (or rows of blocks) and all pixels (or blocks) in each row
for the mipmap level. It does not include any bytes in `mipPadding`.

The exception is non-array cubemap textures (any texture where
`numberOfFaces` is 6 and `numberOfArrayElements` is 0). For these
textures `imageSize` is the number of bytes in each face of the texture
for the current LOD level, not including bytes in `cubePadding` or
`mipPadding`.

=== cubePadding
For non-array cubemap textures (any texture where `numberOfFaces` is
6 and `numberOfArrayElements` is 0) `cubePadding` contains between 0
and 3 bytes to ensure that the data in each face begins at a file
offset that is a multiple of 4. In all other cases `cubePadding` is
empty (0 bytes long).

=== mipPadding
Between 0 and 3 bytes to make sure that all `imageSize` fields are
at a file offset that is a multiple of 4.

== General comments
The unpack alignment is 4. I.e. uncompressed pixel data is packed
according to the rules described in section 8.4.4.1 of the OpenGL
4.6 specification <<OPENGL46>> for a GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT of 4.

Values listed in tables and sections referred to in the OpenGL 4.6
<<OPENGL46>> and Vulkan 1.0 <<VULKAN10>> specifications may be
supplemented by extensions. The references are given as examples
and do not imply that all of those texture types can be loaded in
any particular version of OpenGL {,ES} or Vulkan.

== Predefined Key-Value Pairs

=== Image Orientation
Texture data in a KTX file are arranged so that the first pixel in
the data stream for each face and/or array element is closest to
the origin of the texture coordinate system. In OpenGL that origin
is conventionally described as being at the lower left, but this
convention is not shared by all image file formats and content
creation tools, so there is abundant room for confusion.

The desired texture axis orientation is often predetermined by,
e.g. a content creation tool's or existing application's use of the
image. Therefore it is strongly recommended that tools for generating
KTX files clearly describe their behaviour, and provide an option
to specify the texture axis origin and orientation relative to the
logical orientation of the source image. At minimum they should
provide a choice between top-left and bottom-left as origin for 2D
source images, with the positive S axis pointing right. Where
possible, the preferred default is to use the logical upper-left
corner of the image as the texture origin. Note that this is contrary
to the standard interpretation of GL texture coordinates. However,
the majority of texture compression tools use this convention.

As an aid to writing image manipulation tools and viewers, the
logical orientation of the data in a KTX file may be indicated in
the file's key/value metadata. Note that this metadata affects only
the logical interpretation of the data, has no effect on the mapping
from pixels in the file byte stream to texture coordinates. The
recommended key to use is:

-   KTXorientation

It is recommended that viewing and editing tools support at least
the following values:

-   S=r,T=d
-   S=r,T=u
-   S=r,T=d,R=i
-   S=r,T=u,R=o

where

-   S indicates the direction of increasing S values
-   T indicates the direction of increasing T values
-   R indicates the direction of increasing R values
-   r indicates increasing to the right
-   l indicates increasing to the left
-   d indicates increasing downwards
-   u indicates increasing upwards
-   o indicates increasing out from the screen (moving towards viewer)
-   i indicates increasing in towards the screen (moving away from viewer)

Although other orientations can be represented, it is recommended
that tools that create KTX files use only the values listed above
as other values may not be widely supported by other tools.

=== Swizzle

[NOTE]
.Differences between OpenGL and Vulkan Swizzle
====
* Vulkan uses an enum, VkComponentSwizzle, with values from 0 (IDENTITY)
  to 6 (SWIZZLE_A). OpenGL uses the values of the existing constants
  GL_RED (0x1903), GL_GREEN (0x1904), GL_BLUE (0x1905), GL_ALPHA (0x1906),
  GL_ZERO (0) and GL_ONE (1).

* OpenGL does not have an identity swizzle.

* Vulkan has a struct VkComponentMapping while OpenGL uses an array of
  component swizzle values.
====

The recommended key for indicating desired component mapping for a
texture is;

-   KTXswizzle

The format of the value is

-   R=<swizzle>,G=<swizzle>,B=<swizzle>,A=<swizzle>

where <swizzle> is one character from the set [01rgba]. For example

-   R=b,G=r,B=g,A=1

If not set, you will get the identity, i.e. no, swizzle.

== Issues
[qanda]
How to refer to the DF descriptor block?::
  _Discussion:_ There is no such data type as `dfDesriptorBlock` but
  using primitive types would effectively mean repeating the
  definition of a descriptor block here which we do not want to do.
+
_Resolved:_ Show that `dfDescriptorBlock` is used as a shorthand for
<<KDF12>>'s _Descriptor block_.

How to handle endianness of the DF descriptor block?::
  _Discussion_: The DF spec says data structures are assumed to be
  little-endian for purposes of data transfer. This is incompatible
  with the net which is big-endian and incompatible with `endianness`.
  What should we do?
+
_Unresolved._

Can we guarantee the DF descriptor blocks are always a multiple of 4 bytes?::
  _Discussion_ The _Khronos Basic Data Format Descriptor Block_ is
  a multiple of 4 bytes (24 + 16 x number of samples). Is there
  anything to require that extensions' block sizes be a multiple of
  4 bytes? Need to maintain alignment.
+
_Resolved:_ The Data Format Specification will be updated to recommend
but not require padding. This spec. will require padding.

Should KTX2 support level sizes > 4GB?::
  _Discussion:_ Users have reported needing base levels > 4GB for 3D
  textures.  For this the `imageSize` field needs to be 64-bits. Loaders
  on 32-bit systems will have to ensure correct handling of this and
  check that `imageSize` \<= 4GB, before loading.
+
_Unresolved:_

Should KTX2 provide a way to distinguish between rectangle and regular 2D textures?::
  _Discussion:_ The difference is that unnormalized texel coordinates
  are used for sampling via a special sampler type in GLSL and, in the
  case of OpenGL {,ES}, the special TEXTURE_RECTANGLE target is used. If
  needed this could be supported by a metadata item instructing to use
  unnormalized texel coordinates.
+
_Unresolved:_

Should KTX2 provide a way to distinguish between 1D textures and buffer textures?::
  _Discussion:_ The difference is how you use the data in OpenGL.
  With buffer textures the image data is stored in a buffer object.
  Note that a TextureView can be used to give a different view of the
  data so supporting buffer textures probably requires metadata to
  indicate a preferred view as well as metadata to indicate
  the data should be loaded in a buffer.
+
_Unresolved:_

Should KTX2 support contexts that do not support sized internal fomats?::
  _Discussion:_ OpenGL ES 1.x and 2.0 do not support sized internal
  formats. The `glBaseInternalFormat` field was included in the header
  for easy support of these older versions. Now seems a good time to
  drop this field.
+
_Resolved:_ Drop `glBaseInternalFormat`. When loading to older version
contexts the value of `glFormat` can be used instead.

Use alphanumeric characters or binary values for component swizzles?::
  _Discussion:_ Values in the swizzle metadata could be either a
  character from the set [01rgba] or numeric values corresponding to the
  VkComponentSwizzle enum values from 0 to 6. In the latter case values
  could be expressed in binary or as numeric characters. The
  GL token values have been eliminated from this choice because they
  are not user friendly.
+
_Resolved:_ Use alphanumeric characters from the set [01rgba].

Is anything needed to support sparse textures?::
  _Discussion:_ Sparse textures are provided by the
  `GL_ARB_sparse_textures` extension and are a standard feature of
  Vulkan.  Are any additional KTX features needed to support them?
+
_Unresolved:_

Should KTX2 support metadata for effective use of Vulkan SCALED formats?::
  _Discussion:_ Vulkan SCALED formats convert int (or uint) values
  to unnormalized floating point values, equivalent to specifying a
  value of `GL_FALSE` for the `normalized` parameter to
  `glVertexAttribFormat`. Generally when using such data, associated
  scale and bias values are folded into the transformation matrix.
  Should KTX2 specify standard metadata for these?
+
_Resolved:_ Not at this time. These formats are primarily for vertex
data and several Vulkan vendors have said they can't support them
as texture formats. Metadata can be easily added in future.

Should Global Compression be per-mip-level compression?::
  _Discussion:_ Should zlib, etc. be applied to each mip level rather than
  globally? If per level, contents could still be streamed. There would
  be a compression dictionary per level but the overall effect on
  the data size is unclear.
+
_Unresolved:_
