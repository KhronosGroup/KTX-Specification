== Abstract
The KTX file format, version 2 is a format for storing textures
for OpenGL^®^, OpenGL ES^™️^, Vulkan^®^ and WebGL^™️^ applications.  It is
distinguished by the simplicity of the loader required to instantiate
texture objects from the file contents.

It extends the version 1 format with support for easier loading of Vulkan
textures, easier use by non-OpenGL and non-Vulkan applications, support
for streaming and supercompression.

=== Status of this document

Ready for trial implementation. Be aware that changes may be made
if issues are discovered during trial. In particular changes may
be made to the DFD support. KTX2 files to this specification should
_NOT_ be distributed.

== Introduction

This document describes the KTX file format version 2.0, hereafter
referred to as _KTX2_^™️^. KTX2 files are used for storing textures for
use with 3D APIs such as OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan.

The canonical version of the specification is available in the
Khronos Registry ({url-khr-reg}). The source files used to generate
the specification are stored in the KTX-Specification Repository
(https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Specification).  The source
repository has a public issue tracker and allows the submission of
pull requests that improve the specification.

KTX2 files can contain almost any of the wide variety of image
formats supported by GPUs. Other specifications wishing to refer
to KTX2 as a container may wish to restrict the range of image
formats or other items that can be used. Such referrers must establish
a way to identify that given KTX2 files are compliant with their
subsets such as by adding a metadata item.

=== Document Conventions

The KTX2 specification is intended for use by both creators and
consumers of KTX2 files forming a contract between these parties.
Specification text may address either party; typically the intended
audience can be inferred from context

==== Normative Terminology

Within this specification, the key words must, required, should,
recommended, may, and optional are to be interpreted as described
in _Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels_
<<RFC2119>>.  In text addressing creators, their use expresses
requirements that apply to the files produced.  In text addressing
consumers, their use expresses requirements that must be followed
when, e.g, uploading the textures via a 3D API.

==== Admonitions

NOTE: Notes are non-normative and give further background information
such as rationales.

TIP: Tips are non-normative and give helpful suggestions for
implementers or users.

IMPORTANT: Importants are normative and give directions for
implementers.

CAUTION: Cautions are normative and give restrictions that must be
followed.

compressed formats as given in the format's section of the Khronos
Data Format specification <<KDF13>>.

A _block_ is a single pixel for uncompressed formats and
stem:[block\_width \times block\_height \times block\_depth]
pixels for block compressed formats.

== Field Descriptions

=== identifier
The file identifier is a unique set of bytes that will differentiate the file
from other types of files. It consists of 12 bytes, as follows:
[source,c]
----
Byte[12] FileIdentifier = {
  0xAB, 0x4B, 0x54, 0x58, 0x20, 0x32, 0x30, 0xBB, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A
}
----
This can also be expressed using C-style character definitions as:
[source,c]
----
Byte[12] FileIdentifier = {
  '«', 'K', 'T', 'X', ' ', '2', '0', '»', '\r', '\n', '\x1A', '\n'
}
----
The rationale behind the choice of values in the identifier is based
on the rationale for the identifier in the PNG specification. This
identifier both identifies the file as a KTX file and provides for
immediate detection of common file-transfer problems.

  * Byte [0] is chosen as a non-ASCII value to reduce the probability that a
    text file may be misrecognized as a KTX file.
  * Byte [0] also catches bad file transfers that clear bit 7.
  * Bytes [1..6] identify the format, and are the ASCII values for the string
    "KTX 20".
  * Byte [7] is for aesthetic balance with byte 1 (they are a matching pair
    of double-angle quotation marks).
  * Bytes [8..9] form a CR-LF sequence which catches bad file transfers that
    alter newline sequences.
  * Byte [10] is a control-Z character, which stops file display under MS-DOS,
    and further reduces the chance that a text file will be falsely recognized.
  * Byte [11] is a final line feed, which checks for the inverse of the CR-LF
    translation problem.

=== vkFormat
`vkFormat` specifies the image format using Vulkan `VkFormat` enum
values. It can be any value defined in core Vulkan 1.1 <<VULKAN11>>,
future core versions or by a registered Vulkan extension. Values
defined by core Vulkan 1.1 are given in
{url-khr-vulkan}/specs/1.1/html/vkspec.html#formats-definition[section
32.1 _Format Definition_] of <<VULKAN11>>.  The list of registered
extensions is provided in the {url-khr-vulkan}/#repos[Khronos
Vulkan Registry]. A complete list of values defined by both core
Vulkan 1.1 and extensions can be found in
{url-khr-vulkan}/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#formats-definition[section
37.1 _Format Definition_] of <<VULKAN11EXT>>.

NOTE: The section number given for <<VULKAN11EXT>> is as of this
writing (Vulkan 1.1.117). It is subject to change as future extensions
are added to the document but the link should remain valid as it is to
an internal anchor.

`vkFormat` can be `VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED` (0) if the format of the data
is a not a recognized Vulkan format. The data layout is always given by
the Data Format Descriptor.

Values listed in <<prohibitedFormats>> must not be used nor any
`\*_SCALED_*` formats added in future.  The table in <<formatMapping>>
gives the mapping for all `VkFormat` enum values in Vulkan 1.1 core
and the extensions known at the time of writing, to the equivalent
OpenGL format (internal format, format and type values), DXGI_FORMAT
and MTLPixelFormat. Applications must use these mappings. If
<<formatMapping>> does not have an entry for the value of `vkFormat`,
and a mapping for one or more of the other APIs exists the KTX2
writer must provide that mapping using one or more of the metadata
items described in <<formatMappingMetadata>>. This includes the
case of `VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED`.

[TIP]
====
Before loading any image, Vulkan loaders should confirm via
`vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties` that the Vulkan physical
device (`VkDevice`) supports the the intended use of the format.

Vulkan applications using a core Vulkan format whose name has the
`_BLOCK` suffix must ensure they enable the corresponding
`textureCompression*` physical device feature at `VkDevice` creation
time. Those using formats defined by extensions must ensure they
enable the defining extension at `VkDevice` creation time.

Vulkan applications handling textures whose formats are not known at
`VkDevice` creation time are recommended to enable all available texture
compression features and format defining extensions when creating a
device.

|===

[NOTE]
.Rationale
====
The A8B8G8R8*PACK32 formats are prohibited because the end result
is the same regardless of whether the data is treated as packed
into 32-bits or as the equivalent R8G8B8A8 format, i.e. as an array
of 4 bytes, and a Data Format Descriptor cannot distinguish between
these cases.

The \*SCALED* formats are prohibited because they are intended for
vertex data, very few, if any, implementations support using them
for texturing and a Data Format Descriptor cannot distinguish
these from `int` values having the same bit pattern.
====

[CAUTION]
.Legacy Formats
====
The legacy OpenGL & OpenGL ES formats specified by the following
extensions, do not have equivalent Vulkan formats and are not
supported.

- OES_compressed_paletted_texture
- AMD_compressed_3DC_texture
- AMD_compressed_ATC_texture
- 3DFX_texture_compression_FXT1
- EXT_texture_compression_latc

Only a few of these formats can be described without an extended
Data Format Descriptor so `VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED` must not be used
as a workaround.

This is felt to be an acceptable trade-off for simplifying this
specification as the formats are not in wide use and applications
needing them can use KTX version 1.
====

==== Depth and Stencil Formats
Despite Vulkan requiring separate uploads of depth and stencil
components, combined depth/stencil pixel formats can be used with KTX.
[NOTE]
.Rationale
====
Other GPU APIs support combined uploads and given KTX data alignment it's
trivial to upload components separately in Vulkan.
====

Depth or stencil formats cannot be used for 3D textures.

`VK_FORMAT_D16_UNORM_S8_UINT` is defined as two 16-bit words per texel.
The first word contains the D16 value. The second word contains the S8
value in the eight LSBs and zeros in the eight MSBs.

`VK_FORMAT_D24_UNORM_S8_UINT` is defined as one 32-bit word per texel
with the S8 value in the eight LSBs of the word and the D24 value in the MSBs.

`VK_FORMAT_X8_D24_UNORM_PACK32` is defined as one 32-bit word per texel
with the D24 value in the LSBs of the word and zeros in the eight MSBs.

`VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT_S8_UINT` is defined as two 32-bit words per
texel.  The first word contains the floating-point D32 value. The
second word contains the S8 value in the eight LSBs and zeros in
the MSBs.

`VK_FORMAT_S8_UINT`, `VK_FORMAT_D16_UNORM`, and `VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT`
are defined as in <<VULKAN11EXT>>.

=== typeSize
`typeSize` specifies the size of the data type in bytes used to
upload the data to a graphics API. When `typeSize` is greater than
1, software on big-endian systems must endian convert all image
data since it is little-endian. When format is `VK_UNKNOWN`,
`typeSize` must equal 1. For formats whose Vulkan names have the
suffix `_BLOCK` it must equal 1. For formats with the suffix `_PACKxx`
it must equal the value of stem:[xx / 8]. For unpacked formats,
except combined depth/stencil formats, it must equal the number of
bytes needed for a single component which can be derived from the
format name. E.g for `VK_FORMAT_R16G16B16_UNORM` it will be stem:[16
/ 8].  This means it will equal 1 for any format with 8-bit components.
For `VK_FORMAT_D16_UNORM_S8_UINT`, using the layout defined in this
specification, the value will be 2 and for the other combined
depth/stencil formats the value will be 4.

[NOTE]
.Rationale
====
Although `typeSize` can be calculated from the Data Format Descriptor
and big-endian machines are in the minority we have chosen to provide
a useful piece of data instead of the 4 bytes of padding that would
otherwise be needed for proper alignment of `sgdByteOffset`.
====

=== pixelWidth, pixelHeight, pixelDepth [[dimensions]]
The size of the texture image for level 0, in pixels.

Image dimensions must adhere to format-specific requirements, including:

* width and height being multiples of 4 for BCn and ETC1/ETC2/EAC formats;
* width, height, and depth being multiples of the corresponding block size
dimensions for ASTC formats;
* various restrictions for PVRTC formats (see <<PVRTC>>, <<PVRTC1_OES>>, and
<<PVRTC2_OES>>).

For 1D textures, `pixelHeight` and `pixelDepth` must be 0.

For 2D and cubemap textures, `pixelDepth` must be 0.

For cubemap textures, `pixelHeight` must be equal to `pixelWidth`.

`pixelWidth` cannot be 0.

`pixelDepth` must be 0 for depth or stencil formats.

=== layerCount
`layerCount` specifies the number of array elements. If
the texture is not an array texture, `layerCount` must
equal 0.

Although current graphics APIs do not support 3D array textures, KTX
files can be used to store them.

Refer to <<_texture_type>> for more details about valid values.

=== faceCount
`faceCount` specifies the number of cubemap faces. For cubemaps
and cubemap arrays this must be 6. For non cubemaps this must be 1.
Cubemap faces are stored in the order: +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z.

Applications wanting to store incomplete cubemaps should flatten faces
into a 2D array and use the metadata described in <<KTXcubemapIncomplete>>
to signal which faces are present.

=== levelCount
`levelCount` specifies the number of levels in the <<_mip_level_array,_Mip
Level Array_>> and, by extension, the number of indices in the
`<<_level_index,Level Index>>` array.  A KTX file does not need to
contain a complete mipmap pyramid.  Mip level data is ordered from
the level with the smallest size images, stem:[level_p] to that
with the largest size images, stem:[level_{base}] where stem:[p =
levelCount - 1] and stem:[base = 0].  stem:[level_p] must not be
greater than the maximum possible, stem:[level_{max}], where

[stem]
// max = log2(max(pixelWidth, pixelHeight, pixelDepth))
+++++
max = \log _2\left(\max\left(pixelWidth, pixelHeight, pixelDepth\right)\right)
+++++

stem:[levelCount = 1] means that a file contains only the
first level and the texture isn't meant to have other levels. E.g.,
this could be a LUT rather than a natural image.

stem:[levelCount = 0] is allowed, except for block-compressed
formats, and means that a file contains only the first level and
consumers, particularly loaders, should generate other levels if
needed.

=== supercompressionScheme
`supercompressionScheme` indicates if a supercompression scheme has
been applied to the data in `<<_levelimages, levelImages>>`.  It
must be one of the values from <<supercompressionSchemes>>. A value
of `0` indicates no supercompression.

|===

[small]
1. Reserved for KTX use.
2. Reserved for vendor compression schemes. A registry will be
   established from which vendors can request assignment of values
   thus avoiding conflicts.
3. Reserved. Do not use.

The supercompression scheme is applied independently to each mip
level to permit streaming and random access to the levels. The
format of the data in `<<levelImages>>` for a scheme is specified
in the reference given in the _Level Data Format_ column of
<<supercompressionSchemes>>.

Schemes that require data global to all levels can store it as
described in `<<supercompressionGlobalData>>`. Currently only Basis
Universal uses global data. The format of the global data for a scheme
is specified in the reference given in the _Global Data Format_
column of <<supercompressionSchemes>>.

When a supercompression scheme is used, the image data must be
inflated from the scheme prior to GPU sampling.

IMPORTANT: Implementations are only required to support _None_ and
_Basis Universal_. Support of other schemes is optional.

[TIP]
====
LZW-style lossless supercompression, e.g, schemes 2 and 3, is
generally ineffective on the block-compressed data of GPU texture
formats. It is best reserved for use with uncompressed texture
formats or with block-compressed data that has been specially
optimized for LZW-style supercompression, such as by _Rate Distortion
Optimization_ mode <<RDO>>.

Basis Universal is specially designed for supercompression of some
block-compressed texture formats and includes rate distortion
optimization.
====

==== Scheme Notes (Normative)
===== Basis Universal
* `<<_vkformat,vkFormat>>` must be `VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED` (0x00)
  and the <<_data_format_descriptor,_Data Format Descriptor_>> must
  not have any sample information. See Section 5.19 "Unsized Formats"
  of <<KDF13>>. The values of colorModel, colorPrimaries,
  transferFunction and flags from the DFD describing the pre-deflation
  image data must be preserved in the post-deflation DFD.

[NOTE]
.Rationale
====
The Basis Universal encoder combines encoding to ETC1S and deflation.
Its transcoder combines inflation with transcoding to one of many
possible block compressed formats. There is therefore no common
pre- and post-supercompression format and, if there was, it would
not be visible.
====

===== ZLIB

* With Deflate <<DEFLATE>> compression scheme.

===== Zstandard
* Only _Zstandard_ frames are required. Inflators may skip _Skippable_
  frames.

* Checksums are optional. If a checksum is present, inflators should
  verify it.

=== Index
An index giving the byte offsets from the start of the file and byte
sizes of the various sections of the KTX file.

==== dfdByteOffset
The offset from the start of the file of the
`<<_dfdtotalsize,dfdTotalSize>>` field of the
<<_data_format_descriptor,_Data Format Descriptor_>>.

==== dfdByteLength
The total number of bytes in the <<_data_format_descriptor,_Data
Format Descriptor_>> including the `<<_dfdtotalsize,dfdTotalSize>>`
field. `dfdByteLength` must equal
`<<_dfdtotalsize,dfdTotalSize>>`.

[NOTE]
====
This field is not necessary. Since no padding is needed for DFDs
the value is easily calculated from the offsets. However, if it is
removed, we would need 4 bytes of padding instead for proper alignment
of `supercompressionGlobalData`. Retaining it means all sections of
the file can be handled uniformly.
====

==== kvdByteOffset
An arbitrary number of <<_keyvalue_data,key/value pairs>> may
follow the Index. These can be used to encode any arbitrary data.
The `kvdByteOffset` field gives the offset of this data, i.e.
that of first key/value pair, from the start of the file.  The value
must be 0 when `kvdByteLength` = 0.

==== kvdByteLength
The total number of bytes of key/value data including all
`<<_keyandvaluebytelength,keyAndValueByteLength>>` fields, all
`<<_keyandvalue,keyAndValue>>` fields and all
`<<_valuepadding,valuePadding>>` fields.

==== sgdByteOffset
The offset from the start of the file of
`<<_supercompressionglobaldata,supercompressionGlobalData>>`. The
value must be 0 when `sgdByteLength` = 0.

==== sgdByteLength
The number of bytes of
`<<_supercompressionglobaldata,supercompressionGlobalData>>`.  It
schemes the value is 0.

==== Level Index
An array, `levels`, giving the offset from the start of the file and
compressed and uncompressed byte sizes of the image data for each
mip level within the <<_mip_level_array,_Mip Level Array_>> The array is ordered
starting with stem:[level_{base}] (the level with the largest size images)
at index _0_. Image for stem:[level_p] will be found at index _p_.

===== levels[p].byteOffset

The offset from the start of the file of the first byte of image data
for mip level _p_.

===== levels[p].byteLength

The total size of the data for supercompressed mip level _p_.

`levels[p].byteLength` is the number of bytes of pixel data in
LOD stem:[level_p]. This includes all z slices, all faces, all rows
(or rows of blocks) and all pixels (or blocks) in each row for the
mip level. It does not include any bytes in
`<<_mippadding,mipPadding>>`.

===== levels[p].uncompressedByteLength

`levels[p].uncompressedByteLength` is the number of bytes of
pixel data in LOD stem:[level_p] after reflation from supercompression.
This includes all z slices, all faces, all rows (or rows of blocks)
and all pixels (or blocks) in each row for the mipmap level. It
does not include any bytes in `<<_mippadding,mipPadding>>`.  When
`supercompressionScheme == 0`,
`<<_levelsp_bytelength,levels[p].byteLength>>` must have
the same value as this.

The value of a level's `uncompressedByteLength` must satisfy the
following condition:
[listing]
----
uncompressedByteLength % (faceCount * max(1, layerCount)) == 0
----

[TIP]
====
In versions of OpenGL < 4.5 and in OpenGL ES, faces of non-array
cubemap textures (any texture where `faceCount` is 6 and
`layerCount` is 0) must be uploaded individually. Loaders
wishing to minimize the size of their intermediate buffers may want
to read the faces individually rather then as a block of size
`level[n].uncompressedByteLength`.
====

=== Data Format Descriptor
The Data Format Descriptor (_dfDescriptor_) describes the layout
of the texel blocks in `data`.  The full specification for this is
found in the _Khronos Data Format Specification_ version 1.3
<<KDF13>>.

The dfDescriptor is partially expanded in this specification in
order to provide sufficient information for a KTX2 file to be parsed
without having to refer to <<KDF13>>. It consists of a total size
field and one or more Descriptor Blocks (_dfDescriptorBlock_)
described below.

[NOTE]
.Rationale
====
A _dfDescriptor_ is useful in the following cases:

* precise color management using the descriptor's color space
  information,
* easier use of the images by non-OpenGL and non-Vulkan applications.
  There will be no need for large tables to interpret format enums.
* easier calculation of the offsets of each level, face and layer within
  the data. Again there will be no need for large tables.
====

The following restrictions must be obeyed when setting the fields of the
DFD. The fields mentioned here occur in a dfDescriptorBlock.

* The value of `<<_vkformat,vkFormat>>` and the image data must
  never contradict the DFD and, vice-versa, the DFD must not contradict
  `<<_vkformat,vkFormat>>`.
* `color_model` must be `KHR_DF_MODEL_RGBSDA`, `KHR_DF_MODEL_YUVSDA`
  or one of the block compressed color models listed in <<KDF13>> Section
  5.6 or its successors, currently `KDF_DF_MODEL_BC1A` to
  `KDF_DF_MODEL_PVRTC2`.
* `color_primaries` may be any of the available values since
  conversion of the selected primaries and white point a display's
  can be done with simply a 3x3 matrix multiply.

[NOTE]
====
`KHR_DF_PRIMARIES_BT709/SRGB` is recommended for low dynamic range,
standard gamut images.
====
* `transfer_function` must be `KHR_DF_TRANSFER_LINEAR` or
  `KHR_DF_TRANSFER_SRGB` since these are the only ones supported by the
  vast majority of graphics hardware and correct filtering and blending
  without hardware support is difficult to impossible.
* If `<<_vkformat,vkFormat>>` is one of the `+*_SRGB{,_*}+` formats then
  `transfer_function` must be `KHR_DF_TRANSFER_SRGB` and vice-versa.
  For all other non-YUV formats `transfer_function` must be
  `KHR_DF_TRANSFER_LINEAR`.

[NOTE]
.Editors Note
====
Whether KTX2 will support YUV images is not yet decided.
`transfer_function` restrictions for YUV formats will be updated as
necessary.
====

The _dfDescriptor_ describes the texel blocks as they are when
`<<_supercompressionscheme,supercompressionScheme>> == 0` or after reflation when
`<<_supercompressionscheme,supercompressionScheme>> != 0`.

==== dfdTotalSize
Called `total_size` in <<KDF13>>, `dfdTotalSize` indicates the total
number of bytes in the _dfDescriptor_ including `dfdTotalSize` and
all `dfdBlock` fields.  `<<_dfdbytelength,dfdByteLength>>`
must equal `dfdTotalSize`.

If
[stem]
+++++
dfdTotalSize \neq kvdByteOffset - dfdByteOffset
+++++
the file is invalid.

[NOTE]
====
`dfdTotalSize` is included so that the KTX file contains a complete
descriptor as defined in <<KDF13>>.
====

==== dfdBlock
A `Descriptor Block` as defined in <<KDF13>>, the high-order 16
bits of its first UInt32 are the `descriptor_type` and the high-order
16 bits of the second UInt32 are the `descriptor_block_size`.
`descriptor_block_sizes` are mandated to be multiples of 4
which guarantees that the following `keyAndValueByteLength`
will be aligned in a 32-bit word.

=== Key/Value Data
Key/Value data consists of a set of key/value pairs. The number of
pairs is such that
[stem]
+++++
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left\lceil{\frac{keyAndValueByteLength[i]}{4}}\right\rceil * 4
+ keyAndValueByteLength[n] = kvdByteLength.
+++++

Any file that does not meet the above condition is invalid.

KTX2 editors must preserve any key/value data they do not understand
or which is not modified by the user.

Key/value data must be written to the file sorted by the Unicode
code points of the keys starting from a key's first character.

==== keyAndValueByteLength
The number of bytes of combined key and value data in one key/value
pair. This includes the size of the key, the required NUL byte
terminating the key, and all the bytes of data in the value. If the
value is a UTF-8 string it should be NUL terminated and
`keyAndValueByteLength` should include the NUL character (but code
that reads KTX files must not assume that value fields are NUL
terminated). `keyAndValueByteLength` does not include the bytes in
`<<_valuepadding,valuePadding>>`.

==== keyAndValue
`keyAndValue` contains 2 separate sections. First it contains a key
encoded in UTF-8 without a byte order mark (BOM). The key must be
terminated by a NUL character (a single 0x00 byte). Keys that begin
with the 3 ASCII characters 'KTX' or 'ktx' are reserved and must
not be used except as described by this specification (this version
of the KTX spec. defines eight keys). Immediately following the NUL
character that terminates the key is the Value data.

The Value data may consist of any arbitrary data bytes. Any byte
value is allowed. It is encouraged that the value be a NUL terminated
UTF-8 string without a BOM, but this is not required. If the Value data
is binary, it is a sequence of bytes rather than of words. It is up to
the vendor defining the key to specify how those bytes are to be
interpreted (including the endianness of any encoded numbers). If
the Value data is a string of bytes then the NUL termination should
be included in the `keyAndValueByteLength` byte count (but programs
that read KTX files must not rely on this).

==== valuePadding
Contains between 0 and 3 bytes of value `0x00` to ensure that the
byte following the last byte in `valuePadding` is at a file offset
that is a multiple of 4. This ensures that every `keyAndValueByteLength`
field is 4-byte aligned. This padding is included in the
`<<_kvdbytelength,kvdByteLength>>` field but not the
individual `keyAndValueByteLength` fields.

=== Supercompression Global Data
==== supercompressionGlobalData
An array of data used by certain supercompression schemes that must
be available before any mip level can be expanded. Must start on an
the next 8-byte boundary following the key/value data. For some schemes,
the specification for this data block is given below.

[#basisu_gd]
==== Basis Universal Global Data

Basis Universal combines encoding to ETC1S (a block-compressed
texture format that is a subset of ETC1, see <<KDF13>>) then
supercompressing the result using a lossless compression scheme
with similarites to LZMA.  It creates a global codebook referenced
by each supercompressed image. The global data block contains this
codebook in the form of supercompressed ETC1S endpoint and selector
data and huffman tables.

It also contains an array of _image descriptors_ with flags for each image
and the offset and length within the image's mip level of the data for
that image. Images may consist of 1 or 2 _slices_ depending on the
components of the pre-deflation image as detailed below.

_One-component images_ must have the component value replicated in all 3
components of the _rgb_ slice of the compressed data and have no alpha
slice.

_Two-component images_ must have the R component replicated in all 3
components of the rgb slice and the G component replicated in all 3
components of the _alpha_slice.

_Three-component images_ must have their RGB components in the rgb
slice. and no alpha slice.

_Four-component images_ must have their RGB components in the rgb slice
and the alpha component replicated in all 3 components of the alpha
slice.

The structure of the global data is shown below.

===== globalFlags
Flags with information that is the same for all images. The following
flags are valid:
[source,c]
----
isETC1S = 0x01
hasAlphaSlices = 0x02
----

For current Basis Universal, `isETC1S` must be set. The flag is provided
together with `extendedData` to enable future enhancements such as HDR
support.

`hasAlphaSlices` indicates the Basis data contains alpha slices.

NOTE: This does not necessarily mean the texture has an alpha component.

===== origComponentCount
The number of components in the original pre-deflation image.

===== endpointCount
The number of endpoints in <<_endpointsdata,endpointsData>>.

===== selectorCount
The number of selectorss in <<_selectorsdata,selectorsData>>.

===== endpointsByteLength
The length of <<_endpointsdata,endpointsData>>.

===== selectorsByteLength
The length of <<_selectorsdata,selectorsData>>.

===== tablesByteLength
The length of <<_tablesdata,tablesData>>.

===== extendedByteLength
The length of <<_extendeddata,extendedData>>. Must be 0 if `isETC1S` is set in flags.

===== ImageDesc
====== imageFlags
Flags giving information about an individual image. The following flag
is valid:
[source,c]
----
isIFrame = 0x02
----

Basis Universal supports inter-frame (video) encoding for 2D slices.
If `isIFrame` is set the image (frame) is an I frame. That is, it
does not refer to the previous image. If unset, the image is a P
frame. If the file is not a _video_ file it must be unset.

_Video_ files have a <<layerCount>> > 0 and must have <<KTXanimation>>
metadata. The value of <<layerCount>> is the number of frames in the
video. I.e. layers become the temporal axis.

====== rgbSliceByteOffset, rgbSliceByteLength
The offset of the start of the RGB slice within the
<<_levelimages,levelImages>> of its mip level and its byte length.
ahe offset of <<_levelimages,levelImages>> within the file is given
in the <<_level_index,Level Index>>.

====== alphaSliceByteOffset, alphaSliceByteLength
The offset of the start of the alpha slice within the
<<_levelimages,levelImages>> of its mip level and its byte length.

If `hasAlpha` is unset these values must be 0.

===== endpointsData
Compressed endpoints data. The format of this data is described in
T.B.D.

===== selectorsData
Compressed selectors data. The format of this data is described in
T.B.D.

===== tablesData
Huffman tables data. The format of this data is described in T.B.D.

===== extendedData
Extended data. The format of this data is described in T.B.D.

=== Mip Level Array

Mip levels in the array are ordered from the level with the
smallest size images, stem:[level_p] to that with the largest size
images, stem:[level_{base}].

[NOTE]
.Rationale
====
When streaming a KTX file, sending smaller mip levels first can be
used together with, e.g., the `GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL` and
`GL_TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL` texture parameters or appropriate region setting
in a `VkCmdCopyBufferToImage`, to display a low resolution image quickly
without waiting for the entire texture data.
====

==== levelImages
`levelImages` is an array of Bytes holding all the image data for a
level. The offset of a level's `levelImages` is provided by the
 <<_level_index,Level Index>>.

When `<<_supercompressionscheme,supercompressionScheme>> != 0` these
bytes are formatted as specified in the scheme documentation.

=== mipPadding
`mipPadding` is between 0 and 7 bytes of value `0x00` to make sure that all
mip level data starts at a file offset that is a multiple of 8.

== General comments
=== Endianness
KTX {ktxver} files are little endian. All header fields and the
data for all uncompressed texture formats are stored in little
endian order.  Readers on big-endian machines must endian convert
all header UInt32s and UInt64s and, when <<_typesize,typeSize>> is
greater than 1, all `data` to big endian. The data of block compressed
formats, those ending in `*_BLOCK`, does not need endian converting.

If an application on a big-endian machine intends to use the sample
information in the Data Format Descriptor, the DFD must be rewritten
for the endian-converted `data` as the samples describe the data as
laid out in memory. Sample code for rewriting DFDs is given in
<<Data Format Descriptor Endian Conversion>>.

Writers must endian convert these items to little endian on writing
the file.

=== Packing
Rows of uncompressed pixel data are tightly packed. Each row in
memory immediately follows the end of the preceding row. I.e the
data must be packed according to the rules described in section
8.4.4.1 _Unpacking_ of the OpenGL 4.6 specification <<OPENGL46>>
with `GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH` = 0 and `GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` = 1.

=== Texture Type
The type of texture can be determined from the following table. Any
other combination of parameters makes the KTX file invalid.

[options="header"]
|====
|Type|<<dimensions,pixelWidth>>|<<dimensions,pixelHeight>>|<<dimensions,pixelDepth>>|<<_layercount,layerCount>>|<<_facecount,faceCount>>
|1D           |> 0       |0          |0         |0                    |1

|====

== Predefined Key/Value Pairs

=== KTXcubemapIncomplete
A KTX file can be used to store an incomplete cubemap or an array of
incomplete cubemaps. In such a case, `faceCount` must be `1` and
`layerCount` must be equal to the number of faces present
(in case of a single cubemap) or to the number of faces present times
the number of cubemaps (in case of a cubemap array). The faces that are
present must be indicated using the metadata key

-   `KTXcubemapIncomplete`

The value is a one-byte bitfield defined as:

[listing]
-----
00xxxxx1 - +X is present
00xxxx1x - -X is present
00xxx1xx - +Y is present
00xx1xxx - -Y is present
00x1xxxx - +Z is present
001xxxxx - -Z is present
-----

Any value, not matching the mask above is invalid.

At least one face must be present (i.e., value cannot be `0`).

Within the <<levelImages>> structure, faces must be written in the
same order as with complete cubemaps: +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z.

When a texture is a cubemap array, missing/present faces must be
the same for each element.

As with complete cubemaps, `pixelHeight` must be equal to `pixelWidth`.

=== KTXorientation
Texture data in a KTX file are arranged so that the first pixel in
the data stream for each face and/or array element is closest to
the origin of the texture coordinate system. In OpenGL that origin
is conventionally described as being at the lower left, but this
convention is not shared by all image file formats and content
creation tools, so there is abundant room for confusion.

The desired texture axis orientation is often predetermined by,
e.g. a content creation tool's or existing application's use of the
image. Therefore it is strongly recommended that tools for generating
and manipulating KTX files clearly describe their behaviour, and
provide an option to specify the texture axis origin and orientation
relative to the logical orientation of the source image. At minimum
they should provide a choice between top-left and bottom-left as
origin for 2D source images, with the positive S axis pointing
right. Where possible, the preferred default is to use the logical
upper-left corner of the image as the texture origin. Note that
this is contrary to the standard interpretation of GL texture
coordinates. However, most other APIs and the majority of texture
compression tools use this convention.

When writing the logical orientation to the KTX file's metadata,
image manipulation tools and viewers must use the key

-   `KTXorientation`

Note that this metadata affects only the logical interpretation of
the data and has no effect on the mapping from pixels in the file
byte stream to texture coordinates.

The value is a NUL-terminated string formatted depending on the texture type.

[options="header"]
|====
|Type|Format (<<REGEXP>>)
|1D  |`/^[rl]$/`
|2D  |`/^[rl][du]$/`
|3D  |`/^[rl][du][oi]$/`
|====

where

[no-bullet]
- `r` indicates S values increasing to the right
- `l` indicates S values increasing to the left
- `d` indicates T values increasing downwards
- `u` indicates T values increasing upwards
- `o` indicates R values increasing out from the screen (moving towards viewer)
- `i` indicates R values increasing in towards the screen (moving away from viewer)

When a texture is an array, all its elements have the same orientation.

Values not matching the table above are invalid.

It is recommended that viewing and editing tools support at least the following values:

- `rd`
- `ru`
- `rdi`
- `ruo`

Although other orientations can be represented, it is recommended
that tools that create KTX files use only the values listed above
as other values may not be widely supported by other tools.

[#formatMappingMetadata]
=== Format Mapping

When <<formatMapping>> does not have an entry for the value of
`vkFormat`, which will happen for newly added Vulkan formats, the
KTX writer must provide any known mapping via the following key-value
pairs.

Note that the length of these keys, including the terminating `NUL`,
is a multiple of 4 bytes so the values will be 4-byte aligned.

==== KTXglFormat

For OpenGL {,ES} the mapping is specified with the key

- `KTXglFormat`

The value is 12 bytes representing 3 Uint32 values:

[source,c]
----
UInt32 glInternalformat
UInt32 glFormat
UInt32 glType
----

For compressed formats, `glFormat` and `glType` must be set to zero;
and `glInternalformat` must be used for providing mapping.

==== KTXdxgiFormat__

For Direct3D the mapping is specified with the key

- `KTXdxgiFormat__`

The value is a UInt32 (4 bytes) giving the format enum value.

==== KTXmetalPixelFormat

For Metal, the mapping is specified with the key

- `KTXmetalPixelFormat`

The value is a UInt32 (4 bytes) giving the format enum value.

=== KTXswizzle

////
[NOTE]
.Differences between OpenGL and Vulkan Swizzle
====
* Vulkan uses an enum, VkComponentSwizzle, with values from 0 (IDENTITY)
  to 6 (SWIZZLE_A). OpenGL uses the values of the existing constants
  GL_RED (0x1903), GL_GREEN (0x1904), GL_BLUE (0x1905), GL_ALPHA (0x1906),
  GL_ZERO (0) and GL_ONE (1).

* OpenGL does not have an identity swizzle.

* Vulkan has a struct VkComponentMapping while OpenGL uses an array of
  component swizzle values.
====
////

Desired component mapping for a texture can be indicated with the key

-   `KTXswizzle`

The value is a four-byte NUL-terminated string formatted as (<<REGEXP>>):

[no-bullet]
-   `/^[rgba01]{4}$/`

where each symbol represents source component (or fixed value) that
is used for red, green, blue, and alpha values, thus `rgba` being
a default swizzling state.

For example, `rg01` means:

- the red and green channels are sampled from the red and green texture
  components respectively;
- the blue channel is set to zero, ignoring texture data;
- the alpha channel is set to one (fully saturated), ignoring texture data.

When a channel is not present in the texture, a value of `0` must be
used for colors (red, green, and blue) and a value of `1` (fully
saturated) must be used for alpha.

This metadata has no effect on depth or stencil texture formats.

==== Common Mappings

Use the following formats and swizzles to map alpha-only, luminance and
luminance-alpha formats.

Alpha8::
`vkFormat`: `VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM` (9)
 +
`KTXswizzle`: 000r

Luminance8::
`vkFormat`: `VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM` (9)
 +
`KTXswizzle`: rrr1

Luminance8Alpha8::
`vkFormat`: `VK_FORMAT_R8G8_UNORM` (16)
 +
`KTXswizzle`: rrrg

Loaders may opt to detect these cases and use API-provided enums
when available, e.g. for the first case  `GL_ALPHA8` (when using
compatibility profile), `MTLPixelFormatA8Unorm` or `DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM`.

=== KTXwriter
KTX file writers must identify themselves by including a value with
the key

-   `KTXwriter`

The value can be any UTF-8 string that will uniquely identify the tool
writing the file, for example:

[no-bullet]
-   `AcmeCo TexTool v1.0`

Only the most recent writer should be identified.  Editing tools
must overwrite this value when rewriting a file originally written
by a different tool.

=== KTXastcDecodeMode
By default, ASTC decoders produce pixel values with half-float precision for HDR and
linear LDR blocks. KTX file writers may indicate that the data is compatible with
more compact decoding modes (as defined in <<VULKAN11EXT>>, `VK_EXT_astc_decode_mode`)
by using the key

-   `KTXastcDecodeMode`

The value `rgb9e5` means that pixel values could be decoded with RGB9E5 mode.

The value `unorm8` (valid only for LDR formats) means that pixel values could
be decoded witn UNORM8 mode.

Other values are not allowed.

This metadata entry has no effect on and should not be present in KTX files that
use sRGB transfer function.

This metadata entry has no effect on and should not be present in KTX files that
use non-ASTC formats.

=== KTXanimation
The images of a texture array, i.e. when <<_layercount,`layerCount`>>
> 1, can be treated as the frames of a short animation by using the key

-   `KTXanimation`

The value is 12 bytes representing 3 Uint32 values:
[source,c]
----
UInt32 duration
UInt32 timescale
UInt32 isLooped
----

`duration` is the number of _time units_ per frame. `timescale` is the
number of _time units_ per 1 second. Thus the duration of a frame in
seconds is stem:[duration / timescale].

`isLooped` indicates how many times to loop the animation. Values are:

[no-bullet]
* 0 - loops infinitely
* 1 - plays once
* n - plays n times

  on 32-bit systems will have to ensure correct handling of this and
  check that `imageSize` \<= 4GB, before loading.
+
_Resolved:_ Be future proof and make all image-size related fields 64
bits.

Should KTX2 provide a way to distinguish between rectangle and regular 2D textures?::
  _Discussion:_ The difference is that unnormalized texel coordinates
  are used for sampling via a special sampler type in GLSL and, in the
  case of OpenGL {,ES}, the special TEXTURE_RECTANGLE target is used. If
  needed this could be supported by a metadata item instructing to use
  unnormalized texel coordinates.
+
_Unresolved:_

Should KTX2 provide a way to distinguish between 1D textures and buffer textures?::
  _Discussion:_ The difference is how you use the data in OpenGL.
  With buffer textures the image data is stored in a buffer object.
  Note that a TextureView can be used to give a different view of the
  data so supporting buffer textures probably requires metadata to
  indicate a preferred view as well as metadata to indicate
  the data should be loaded in a buffer.
+
_Unresolved:_

Should KTX2 drop the `gl*` fields?::
  _Discussion:_ Narrowing down and enforcing the valid combinations
  of `glFormat`, `glInternalFormat` and `glType` is fraught with
  issues. The spec. could be simplified by dropping them and having
  only `vkFormat`.  The spec can include a table showing a standard
  mapping from the `vkFormat` value to a `glInternalFormat`,
  `glFormat` and `glType` combination.
+
_Resolved:_ Drop the `gl*` fields. OpenGL and OpenGL ES loaders
can include code to do the mapping based on table which will be
added to the spec. Such code is estimated to be about 6 kbytes.

Use alphanumeric characters or binary values for component swizzles?::
  _Discussion:_ Values in the swizzle metadata could be either a
  character from the set [01rgba] or numeric values corresponding to the
  VkComponentSwizzle enum values from 0 to 6. In the latter case values
  could be expressed in binary or as numeric characters. The
  GL token values have been eliminated from this choice because they
  are not user friendly.
+
_Resolved:_ Use alphanumeric characters from the set [01rgba].

Is anything needed to support sparse textures?::
  _Discussion:_ Sparse textures are provided by the
  `GL_ARB_sparse_textures` extension and are a standard feature of
  Vulkan. Are any additional KTX features needed to support them?
+
_Unresolved:_

Should KTX2 support metadata for effective use of Vulkan SCALED formats?::
  _Discussion:_ Vulkan SCALED formats convert int (or uint) values
  to unnormalized floating point values, equivalent to specifying a
  value of `GL_FALSE` for the `normalized` parameter to
  `glVertexAttribFormat`. Generally when using such data, associated
  scale and bias values are folded into the transformation matrix.
  Should KTX2 specify standard metadata for these?
+
_Resolved:_ No. These formats will not be supported. They are
primarily for vertex data and several Vulkan vendors have said they
can't support them as texture formats. Also a DFD cannot distinguish
these from `int` values having the same bit pattern.

Should the supercompression scheme be applied per-mip-level?::
  _Discussion:_ Should each mip level be supercompressed independently
  or should the scheme, zlib, zstd, etc., be applied to all levels
  as a unit? The latter may result in slightly smaller size though
  that is unclear. However it would also mean levels could not be
  streamed or randomly accessed.
+
_Resolved:_ Yes. The benefits of streaming and random access outweigh
what is expected to be a small increase in size.

Should we remove row padding from uncompressed image data?::
  _Discussion:_ Row padding was added to KTX so that data would have the
  default GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT of 4, which was chosen to help speed up DMA
  of rows by the GPU. Modern architectures are apparently not sensitive
  to this as evidenced by Vulkan deliberately omitting any equivalent of
  GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT. Thus an annoying chunk of code is required to
  upload row-padded images to Vulkan.
+
_Resolved:_ Remove this and cube padding. Formats that would need
padding have texel sizes that are less than 4 bytes so no benefit
is obtained by starting cube faces or rows of such images at 4-byte
multiples.

Should we require content checksums anywhere?::
  _Discussion:_ Modern transmission mechanisms, e.g, HTTP2, provide good
  robustness so checksums are less important than they used to be. Some
  supercompressions schemes have checksum which may be optional.
+
_Resolved:_ No. We can rely on modern transmission mechanisms. However if
the supercompression scheme includes a checksum readers should verify
it.

Should we use the DFD to indicate the number of channels in Basis Universal supercompressed data?::
  _Discussion:_ Basis Universal compressed data may have 2, 3 or 4
  channels. The number of channels affects the choice of transcode
  target format. The information could be provided within the
  supercompression global data or by the DFD. Currently presence of
  an alpha channel is indicated by a flag in the global data. There is
  nothing to indicate if there are only 2 channels.
+
_Unresolved:_

The Vulkan 1.1 references are living documents that are updated
weekly with corrections, clarifications and, in the case of
<<VULKAN11EXT>>, newly released extensions. References to the
specifications do not imply that KTX header field values are limited
solely to those in the referenced sections or tables. These values
may be supplemented by extensions or new versions.  They also do
not imply that all of the texture types can be loaded in any
particular version of OpenGL {,ES} or Vulkan.

== Mapping of `vkFormat` values

CAUTION: This section is non-normative.

CAUTION: Provided mappings for BGR(A) formats are based on non-ES OpenGL specifications. See the relevant OpenGL ES extensions for more options.

CAUTION: Half-Float data type uses different enum values on different OpenGL ES and WebGL versions.

CAUTION: Some vendor-specific extensions (e.g. `GL_NV_depth_buffer_float`) define custom enum values for symbols used in the ratified specifications.
